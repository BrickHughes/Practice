# Practice
Folder for all learning-related practice
Hi,

I'm Ian, I love to learn, and currently I'm focused on Python and SQL, but I'm also
spending time on Java, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I'm learning in part in the hopes
of being able to apply it to a career in supply chain management, but I'm having fun
either way.
